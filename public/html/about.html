		<p>Since I was a child, I've been amazed by machinery. Computers were starting to become more common during my childhood. I've discovered the art of computer programming around the age 13, mainly because I wanted to write malware and troll the other kids
		with it. That's how I found out what I really like to do [ programming, not trolling kids ]. Since then, I delved into computer security, algorithms, data structures, software engineering, and basically everything related to computers.</p>
		<p>Here I post mostly stuff which I find interesting. I used to write it down on my notebooks, but I've created this site so that I don't have to carry them any longer.</p>
