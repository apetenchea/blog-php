	Malware authors came up with many methods of increasing the difficulty of static analysis. A simple
	way is to remove the Imports Table.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="article-content">
	<p class="text-justify">
	Almost every program makes use of external libraries. On Windows, the most common one is <strong>kernel32.dll</strong>,
	because it allows one to access the majority of the Windows API. Procedures such as <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682425(v=vs.85).aspx">CreateProcess</a>
	or <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366887(v=vs.85).aspx">VirtualAlloc</a>
	are just a few of those exported by this library.
	</p>
	<h2>Static linking</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Whenever a procedure is statically linked, the linker actually copies data from the library, embedding
	it into the executable. There are some advantages to this, one being portability, since the program
	can run even on systems that don't have the required library installed. Also, since the linking process doesn't
	take place at runtime, the program might have a slightly faster startup. An obvious disadvantage is the increase
	in memory consumption.
	</p>
	<h2>Dynamic linking</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">
	This method is very common. The DLL is loaded into memory once, and all the programs can get data from it.
	This saves a great deal of space, and it can be done either at load time or runtime.
	</p>
	<h3>Load-time dynamic linking</h3>
	<p class="text-justify">
	From the point of view of the programmer, this might be the most straightforward way to link a library.
	The executables contains metadata about linked libraries and procedures. This information is used by the
	<a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684184(v=vs.85).aspx">dynamic linker</a>,
	which finds each library and locates inside it all the corresponding procedures. Then, for each imported procedure, it patches the image with the correct
	address. In case of PE files, the data used by the linker is found in a structure called the
	<a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680547(v=vs.85).aspx#the_.idata_section">Import Table</a>.
	Because all this information is stored inside the executable, it gives away important metadata, which can be used to automate static analysis.
	Let's take a look at a concrete example. In order to display a standard message box, one can use the
	<a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms645505(v=vs.85).aspx">MessageBox</a>
	procedure, found inside <strong>user32.dll</strong>.<br>
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;

int main()
{
	MessageBox(NULL, "HIDDEN", NULL, MB_OK);
	ExitProcess(0);
	return 0;
}</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/">IDA</a> shows me the following imports:
	</p>
	<pre>
00402000  ExitProcess  KERNEL32
00402008  MessageBoxA  USER32</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Because this information exists inside the executable, it is very easy to see that this program makes use of <code>MessageBox</code> and <code>ExitProcess</code>.
	</p>
	<h3>Building the minimum</h3>
	<p class="text-justify">
	When I build these examples, I used <em>Visual Studio Community Edition 2015</em>. <strong>Target</strong> was set to <span class="highlight-green">Release x86</span>.
	In <strong>Project-&gt;Properties-&gt;Linker-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Entry Point</strong> set <span class="highlight-green">main</span> as the entry point.
	Disable <span class="highlight-green">Safe SEH</span>, <span class="highlight-green">Debugging</span>, and <span class="highlight-green">DEP</span>.
	This removes all the checks and security measures added by Visual Studio, keeping the executable as close as possible to the source code.
	These options are very useful for improving the security of the application, but the purpose here is to prevent the compiler from inserting additional imports.
	</p>
	<h3>Run-time dynamic linking</h3>
	<p class="text-justify">
	It is also possible to link procedures at runtime. This process requires a little bit more effort and care from the programmer.
	First of all, the library has to be loaded using <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684175(v=vs.85).aspx">LoadLibrary</a>.
	During this step, the DLL module is mapped into the virtual address space of the process. Afterwards, you can start importing procedures from it.
	To do this, the library handle has to be passed to <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683212(v=vs.85).aspx">GetProcAddress</a>,
	along with the name of a procedure. Finally, a procedure handle is obtained, which is used pretty much like a function pointer. Because this process happens at runtime,
	there will be no information about these procedures available in the Import Table.
	Notice how the code already looks more complicated due to use of function pointers.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;

typedef int(*msg_box) (void *, char *, char *, unsigned int);

int main()
{
	HMODULE user32_dll = LoadLibrary("user32.dll");
	if (!user32_dll) {
		ExitProcess(-1);
	}
	msg_box MsgBox = (msg_box)GetProcAddress(user32_dll, "MessageBoxA");
	if (!MsgBox) {
		ExitProcess(-1);
	}
	MsgBox(NULL, "HIDDEN", NULL, MB_OK);
	ExitProcess(0);
	return 0;
}</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	This time, the full name of the procedure is required. There is no <code>MessageBox</code> procedure in fact,
	there are <code>MessageBoxW</code> (Unicode) and <code>MessageBoxA</code> (ANSI). In case of load-time dynamic linking,
	the compiler chooses one for you.
	</p>
	<pre>
00402000  LoadLibraryA  KERNEL32
00402004  GetProcAddress  KERNEL32
00402008  ExitProcess  KERNEL32</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	There are still a few functions imported from <em>kernel32.dll</em>. <code>LoadLibrary</code> and <code>GetProcAddress</code>
	must appear there in order to link other DLLs at runtime. Notice though that MessageBox is missing. Hence, the Import Table no longer shows
	all the procedures used by the program, but there is still some information. These imports are clearly hinting that there might be more
	happening at run-time. The problem is that in order to link a DLL at runtime, the Windows API is needed.
	By completely removing the Import Table, the program no longer imports <em>kernel32.dll</em>. There is no
	easy way to import stuff at run-time without using it.
	</p>
	<h2>No imports at all</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">
	The most important piece of the puzzle is the base address of <em>kernel32.dll</em>. But since there are
	no imports whatsoever, how does one find it?<br>
	The answer lies on the stack. Let's put it this way: a running image is part of a process, and a process has
	at least one running thread. When starting, the entry point of a thread is called from <em>BaseThreadInitThunk</em>,
	which is an undocumented procedure located inside <em>kernel32.dll</em>.
	When you double-click on an executable, Windows creates a new process, thus starting a new thread.
	This means that <em>BaseThreadInitThunk</em> is called at some point before the actual program starts.
	Underneath that lies a <code>call</code> instruction. This, besides changing the <code>EIP</code>, pushes the
	address of the next instruction onto the stack.
	</p>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="public/img/hidden-imported-procedures/x32.gif" alt="Debugger illustration">
	<p class="text-justify">
	When <code>main</code> is called, an address from inside <em>kernel32.dll</em> is pushed onto the stack. Notice
	the first DWORD on the stack when <em>example3.EntryPoint</em> is reached.
	</p>
	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="public/img/hidden-imported-procedures/stack.png" alt="Stack when entering main.">
	<p class="text-justify">
	By knowing that address, it is possible to obtain the base address of the <em>kernel32.dll</em> module. In order
	to extract it from the stack, some assembly is needed at the very beginning of <code>main</code>.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-x86asm">
mov eax, [esp + 0x4];
mov addr_inside_kernel32, eax;</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Here are the first few instructions of <code>main</code> as seen in the debugger:
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-x86asm">
PUSH EBP
MOV EBP, ESP
MOV EAX, DWORD PTR SS:[ESP + 4]
MOV DWORD PTR DS:[163334], EAX</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	The compiler automatically adds the <em>function prologue</em>. The first instruction is <code>push ebp</code>,
	which puts a DWORD on top of the stack. This means that the return address we're looking for is actually
	the second one in the stack and therefore we add 4 to <em>esp</em> in order to get it.
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Once you know an address inside the library, you need to find the base address.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
#define MZ 0x5a4d
#define JUMP_LEN 0x10000
#define TRIM_4 0xffff0000

/* Given an address inside a module, find the module base address. */
unsigned int GetModuleBase(unsigned int addr)
{
	unsigned int base = addr &amp; TRIM_4;
	while (*(short *)base != MZ) {
		base -= JUMP_LEN;
	}
	return base;
}</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	This code is not based on documented facts. It is rather based on
	experiments. Nevetheless, it seems to work even on Windows 10, at least until Microsoft decides
	to change something.<br>
	It begins by trimming the last four zeros from the given address (in hex). This is because
	the base address of <em>kernel32.dll</em> always seems to end with 4 zeros, meaning that it's a multiple of
	0x10000. As a matter of fact, when I was making that GIF with the debugger, the library's address happened to be 0x74b90000.
	Therefore, only multiples of 0x10000 are checked. The right address is identified by checking if it references
	the WORD <span class="highlight-green">'MZ'</span>. This is how any <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680547(v=vs.85).aspx">Portable Executable</a>
	starts. On the way to the base address, there might be some pages from which reading is not possible. To avoid
	a possible crash, one could use an exception handler.<br>
	In the example above, the value of the <code>addr</code> argument was 0x74ba8744. Trimming it results in
	0x74ba0000. Since the <em>kernel32.dll</em> started at 0x74b90000, only two addresses were checked:
	0x74ba0000 and 0x74b90000.
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
	That was half the battle. The next step is to find the <em>GetProcAddress</em> procedure. Its address can be found in the
	<a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680547(v=vs.85).aspx#the_.edata_section__image_only_">Export Table</a>
	of the library.

	DWORD Characteristics;
	DWORD TimeDateStamp;
	WORD MajorVersion;
	WORD MinorVersion;

	DWORD NumberOfNames;
	DWORD AddressOfFunctions;
	DWORD AddressOfNames;

	<p class="text-justify">
	<code>AddressOfFunctions</code> is the <abbr title="Relative Virtual Address">RVA</abbr> of an array
	containing the RVAs of exported funtions.
	<code>AddressOfNames</code> is the RVA of an array with pointers to strings,
	which denote function names (these 'pointers' are in fact other RVAs).
	<code>AddressOfNameOrdinals</code> is used to correlate the two fields above.
	For example, if the string <em>"GetProcAddress"</em> is located at
	<em>AddressOfNames[5]</em>, then the address of the function is found using <strong>AddressOfFunctions[AddressOfNameOrdinals[5]]</strong>.

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">
	The examples shown here were small and focused on eliminating the <em>Import Table</em>.	
	In real life, a clean application would have no reason to do that, unless it is a crackme or something made
	for didactic purposes.
	Malware authors usually don't use this technique alone, as it is not sufficient.
	Even though the imports are hidden, strings are still visible.<p>
	<pre>
strings.exe example3.exe &gt; strings.txt</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Here are some of the strings</em>:
	</p>
	<pre>
GetProcAddress
ExitProcess
LoadLibraryA
user32.dll
MessageBoxA
HIDDEN</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	They might use a packer or crypter to hide these, or simply xor all strings with some key.
	Either way, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon">Procmon</a>
	or other dynamic analysis tools will unveil these hidden calls to <em>LoadLibrary</em>,
	but in order analyse it dynamically, the executable has to be ran in a safe environment. When automated, static analysis is
	faster, but also more limited.
