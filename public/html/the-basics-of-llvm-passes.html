	<p id="intro" class="lead text-justify">
	LLVM passes allow you to make custom transformations on the intermediate representation of a program, during compilation.
	This article describes the very basics of LLVM passes. All the examples have been tested with LLVM version 5.0.1.
	</p>

<div class="article-content">
	<h2>LLVM IR</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">
	A compiler usually has three main components connected in series: frontend, optimizer and backend.
	The fronted is responsible with the high level stuff, like parsing the code and building the AST, in the end creating 
	an intermediate representation, which makes the job of the other components much easier.
	After that, the optimizer comes with some transformations, which are performed on the intermediate representation.
	These transformations are usually meant to improve memory usage, speed and security. Then the backend
	converts the program into a series of native instructions, targeting a specific architecture.
	</p>

		</figure>
	</div>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Writing a pass involves doing some analysis or transformations at the optimizer level.
	The optimizer is composed out of many passes, organized in a pipeline. Each pass makes a new transformation on the <abbr title="Intermediate Representation">IR</abbr>.
	Modifying the program is not mandatory though, as a pass might just analyze the IR without changing it.
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
	A nice thing about LLVM is the simplified, human readable IR. Let's take a look at an example:
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
	int x;
	scanf("%d", &amp;x);
	printf("%d\n", x * 8);
	return 0;
}</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Generate the IR:
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-bash">
clang -emit-llvm -S example.c</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	The output should be a file named <strong>example.ll</strong>.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-llvm">
define i32 @main() #0 {
	%1 = alloca i32, align 4
	%2 = alloca i32, align 4
	store i32 0, i32* %1, align 4
	%3 = call i32 (i8*, ...) @__isoc99_scanf(i8* getelementptr inbounds ([3 x i8], [3 x i8]* @.str, i32 0, i32 0), i32* %2)
	%4 = load i32, i32* %2, align 4
	%5 = mul nsw i32 %4, 8
	%6 = call i32 (i8*, ...) @printf(i8* getelementptr inbounds ([4 x i8], [4 x i8]* @.str.1, i32 0, i32 0), i32 %5)
	ret i32 0
}</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	It looks like a RISC instruction set. Since the integer is multipled by 8,
	<code>%5 = mul nsw i32 %4, 8</code>, it is possible to transform the multiplication into a left shift:
	<code>%5 = shl nsw i32 %4, 3</code>. You can edit the <strong>.ll</strong> file and then compile it with Clang.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-bash">
clang -o example example.ll
./example
4
32</pre>
	<h2>Optimizing multiplication</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Integer multiplication by powers of 2 is equivalent to left shifting. Because left shifting is faster, it is commonly
	used as an optimization. This could be the purpose of a basic optimization pass:
	<em>replace integer multiplication by powers of 2 with left shifts</em>. These kind of arithmetic optimizations are done automatically
	by Clang, but the scope of this pass is simplicity. Besides, it's interesting to look under the hood and see how such things can be done.
	</p>
	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="public/img/the-basics-of-llvm-passes/pass-chain.png">
	<p class="text-justify">
	The LLVM API comes with multiple levels of abstraction. A program is divided into <a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Module.html">modules</a>.
	A module is divided into <a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Function.html">functions</a>,
	and a function is divided into <a target="_blank" href="llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1BasicBlock.html">basic blocks</a>.
	Finally, a basic block is divided into <a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Instruction.html">instrustions</a>.
	</p>
	<div class="text-center">

	</div>
	<p class="text-justify">
	All passes inherit the base class <a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Pass.html">Pass</a>.
	Depending on how specific you want your pass to be, you can choose to derive it from a multitude of classes, such as
	<a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1ModulePass.html">ModulePass</a>,
	<a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1FunctionPass.html">FunctionPass</a>, or
	<a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1BasicBlockPass.html">BasicBlockPass</a>, to name a few.
	It is advisable to pick the most specific class possible.
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
	For the purpose of this arithmetic optimization pass, <span class="highlight-green">BasicBlockPass</span> is a good choice for a superclass.
	A basic block is a linear sequence of instructions with no branches. You can image a basic block as a node in the control flow graph.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
class MultiplicationPass : public BasicBlockPass {
	public:
		static char ID;
		MultiplicationPass() : BasicBlockPass(ID) {}

		bool runOnBasicBlock(BasicBlock &amp;BB) override {
			return false;
		}
};</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	The entry point of the pass is in the <span class="highlight-green">runOnBasicBlock</span> method,
	which takes a reference to a <span class="highlight-green">BasicBlock</span>. That's where all the optimization magic happens.
	Its return value has to be <strong>true</strong> in case the pass did any modification to the current basic block.<br>
	Passes can depend on other passes, so the order in which they run matters.
	The optimizer has to know when a pass modified something, because a modification might mean new instructions,
	which have to be analyzed by some passes that already ran.<br>
	For example, suppose someone creates a pass which transforms repetitive additions into a single multiplication.
	<span class="highlight-green">y = x + x + x + x</span> gets converted into <span class='highlight-green'>y = x * 4</span>.
	If this pass runs before the pass which optimizes multiplication, everything goes fine.
	If not, this pass might modify some basic blocks by introducing multiplications which were not there before.
	Hence, the optimizer has to run again some of the previous optimization passes, but only on these basic blocks which were
	modified by the current pass.
	That boolean return value allows the optimizer to skip a lot of fruitless computation, running passes only when it has to.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
char MultiplicationPass::ID = 0;

static void registerMultiplicationPass(const PassManagerBuilder &amp;,
		legacy::PassManagerBase &amp;PM) {
	PM.add(new MultiplicationPass());
}

static RegisterStandardPasses MultiplicationPassRegistration(
		PassManagerBuilder::EP_EarlyAsPossible,
		registerMultiplicationPass);</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	LLVM uses the <span class="highlight-green">ID</span> member to identify passes.<br>
	The <span class="highlight-green">PassManager</span> is used to optimize the execution of passes.
	For that, a pass must be registered first. <span class="highlight-green">PassManagerBuilder::EP_EarlyAsPossible</span> hints that
	this pass should be added before any other transforations. Other options can be found
	<a target="_blank" href="https://svn.grid.pub.ro/svn/bhyve-save-restore/trunk/contrib/llvm/include/llvm/Transforms/IPO/PassManagerBuilder.h">here</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Building a pass</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">
	We've ended up with a complete pass skeleton. Let's stop here for a moment to discuss the building process.
	The repository contains the complete pass as well. To clone just the skeleton:
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-bash">
git clone https://github.com/apetenchea/cdroot-sources.git
cd cdroot-sources
git checkout 2c4762cecf94fbde625ea27a4139232149cafcf2</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	I am using <a target="_blank" href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> to generate the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/">Makefile</a>. Basically, after you've cloned it,
	all you have to do is this:
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-bash">
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	The command for compiling the example can be found in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apetenchea/cdroot-sources/blob/master/the-basics-of-llvm-passes/compile.sh">compile.sh</a>.
	If you run this script Clang should include your pass during compilation.
	In case some strange error occurs, there are some troubleshooting tips in the <strong>CMakeLists.txt</strong> files.
	</p>
	<h2>Optimizing multiplication</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">
	A basic block contains one or more instructions. A nice thing about this API is that it
	lets you iterate through it as if BasicBlock was a collection:
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
for (auto it = BB.begin(); it != BB.end(); ++it) {
	Instruction &amp;instruction = *it;
}</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Out of all instructions, we are interested only in the multiplications. Furthermore, this particular optimization
	method cannot be applied when the operands are floating point numbers, so another thing to check for
	is that the multiplication operates only on integers.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
if (instruction.getOpcode() != Instruction::Mul
		|| !instruction.getType()-&gt;isIntegerTy()) {
	continue;
}</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	The optimization is possible only if one of the operands is a constant.
	LLVM offers the <a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html#isa">dyn_cast</a> operator,
	which is similar to the C++ <span class="highlight-green">dynamic_cast</span>. The key feature of this
	operator is that it returns a <span class="highlight-green">null</span> pointer when the cast is not possible.
	So, if both operands fail to be casted to <a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1ConstantInt.html">ConstantInt</a>,
	it means that none of them is a constant.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
int constOperandIdx = 0;
auto *constInt = dyn_cast&lt;ConstantInt&gt;(instruction.getOperand(0));
if (!constInt) {
	constInt = dyn_cast&lt;ConstantInt&gt;(instruction.getOperand(1));
	constOperandIdx = 1;
}
if (!constInt) {
	continue;
}</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Now <span class="highlight-green">constInt</span> is a pointer to the constant operand.
	Being a constant integer is not enough, though.
	In order for the optimization to work, the operand must be a power of 2. LLVM nicely provides
	an abstraction over integer types, using the <a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1APInt.html">APInt</a> class.
	The <a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1APInt.html#a6f1d5427c61a0f0159f6e85f41944c5c">APInt::exactLogBase2</a>
	method returns -1 if the number is not a power of 2.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
int32_t exactLog2 = constInt-&gt;getValue().exactLogBase2();
if (exactLog2 == -1) {
	continue;
}</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Next thing is to create the right shift. <a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1IRBuilder.html">IRBuilder</a>
	can be used to create new instructions. <span class="highlight-green">constOperandIdx</span> is 0 if the first operand of the multiplication
	is a constant, or 1 in case of the second one. In this case, the index of the other operator is simply the negation of <span class="highlight-green">constOperandIdx</span>.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
IRBuilder&lt;&gt; builder(&amp;instruction);
Value *shl = builder.CreateShl(
		instruction.getOperand(!constOperandIdx),
		ConstantInt::get(instruction.getType(), exactLog2));</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	The last step is to replace the old instruction. You have to specify the instruction list, the position of the instruction that you want to
	replace, and the newly created instruction.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
ReplaceInstWithValue(BB.getInstList(), it, shl);</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	That's pretty much it! You can find the complete pass <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apetenchea/cdroot-sources/tree/master/the-basics-of-llvm-passes">here</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Running the pass</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">
	<strong>compile.sh</strong> basically uses Clang to run the pass on the C code and produce an executable.
	You could also run a pass over an <strong>.ll</strong> file and produce another <strong>.ll</strong> file,
	then use that to produce an executable out of the optimized IR code. The programming language doesn't matter for the backend.
	As long as LLVM gets the IR code, it can handle it independently. This is how the frontend is decoupled from the backend.<br>
	Let's see the effect of running the pass on the original <strong>example.ll</strong> file.
	</p>
	<pre>
clang -Xclang -load -Xclang build/multiplication-pass/libMultiplicationPass.so -emit-llvm -S example.ll</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Clang takes the IR and optimizes it (<span class="highlight-green">%5...</span>):
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-llvm">
define i32 @main() #0 {
	%1 = alloca i32, align 4
	%2 = alloca i32, align 4
	store i32 0, i32* %1, align 4
	%3 = call i32 (i8*, ...) @__isoc99_scanf(i8* getelementptr inbounds ([3 x i8], [3 x i8]* @.str, i32 0, i32 0), i32* %2)
	%4 = load i32, i32* %2, align 4
	%5 = shl i32 %4, 3
	%6 = call i32 (i8*, ...) @printf(i8* getelementptr inbounds ([4 x i8], [4 x i8]* @.str.1, i32 0, i32 0), i32 %5)
	ret i32 0
}</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Again, you could compile this using Clang, as if it were a regular <strong>.c</strong> file. This doesn't mean you'll always depend on Clang, though.
	LLVM comes with a complete <a target="_blank" href="https://llvm.org/">toolchain</a>. You can even generate <a target="_blank" href="https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html">LLVM Bitcode</a>,
	which can be executed using the <a target="_blank" href="https://releases.llvm.org/5.0.0/docs/CommandGuide/lli.html">lli JIT compiler</a>.
	If you have multiple versions of LLVM installed, it is better to use full names, including the version.<br>
	Running the example using JIT:
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-bash">
# produce the bitcode
llvm-as-5.0 example.ll
# run it
lli-5.0 example.bc
5
40</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Because it allows one to optimize the intermediate representation regardless of what language was there before, it is possible to write the exact same program in Rust,
	generate the IR, then optimize it using the above pass, generate assembly code, and in the end obtain a working executable compiled with Clang!
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-rust">
use std::io;

fn main() {
	let mut x = String::new();
	io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut x).expect("Error!");
	let x: u32 = x.trim().parse().expect("Error!");
	println!("{}", x * 8);
}</pre>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-bash">
rustc --emit=llvm-ir example.rs</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	The first step is to generate the IR using the rustc compiler.
	<strong>example.ll</strong> looks totally different than the one generated by Clang, but it is still LLVM IR nontheless.
	Now that you have the intermediate representation, you can almost forget that this program was written in Rust.<br>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/opt.html">opt</a> is the LLVM optimizer and analyzer. It can take LLVM IR or
	bitcode and optimize it using a standard or custom passes. In order to use a custom pass, the code has to be modified a bit. The
	following function is added at the end of <strong>MultiplicationPass.cpp</strong>.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-cpp">
static RegisterPass<MultiplicationPass> X("mul", "Turns multiplication by powers of 2 into left shifts.",
		false /* Only looks at CFG */,
		false /* Analysis Pass */);</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	opt will now identify the custom pass as <span class="highlight-green">mul</span>. After the optimization, <a target="_blank" href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llc.html">llc</a>
	is used to convert the IR or bitcode into assembly. Then, it all turns back at Clang, because it can take the assembly and generate an executable.
	</p>
	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="public/img/the-basics-of-llvm-passes/optimization.png" alt="Optimization procedure">
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-bash">
# optimize
opt-5.0 -load ./build/multiplication-pass/libMultiplicationPass.so -mul -o example_opt.ll example.ll

# generate assembly code
llc-5.0 example_opt.ll -o example.s

# create the executable
clang ~/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd-fe0b1b991511fcaa.so example.s -o example</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Notice that I had to link Rust's standard library. That is because the Rust example makes use of that stuff,
	and Clang doesn't know by default where to find it.
	</p>
	<pre class="highlighted-code lang-bash">
./example
9
72</pre>
	<p class="text-justify">
	It works! A great thing about this philosophy is that an optimization pass doesn't have to be compiler specific any longer. You can write it once
	and integrate it wherever you want.
